# Setting Up GitHub Topics

Manual setup (UI):
1. Go to Settings > General
2. Scroll to "Repository topics"
3. Add:
   - ai-support
   - offline-first
   - hipaa-compliant
   - gdpr-compliant
   - it-support
   - jira-integration
   - llm
   - tauri
   - rust
   - react

These improve discoverability for IT teams searching for support tools.

Topics cannot be set via GitHub API, so manual setup is required.
