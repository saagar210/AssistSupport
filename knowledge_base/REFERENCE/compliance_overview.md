### GDPR (European Data)
- Applies to: Any system handling EU resident personal data
- Key requirement: Consent, data minimization, right to deletion, breach notification within 72 hours
- Impact on IT: Data location awareness, encryption, access controls

### SOX (Financial)
- Applies to: Financial systems and reporting

## Why Policies Exist

All IT security policies are designed to maintain compliance with these regulatory frameworks. Bypassing policies (e.g., using flash drives instead of encrypted cloud storage) can result in regulatory violations, fines, and legal liability.
