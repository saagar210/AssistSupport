# Removable Media Policy

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Classification:** MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-15

## Policy Statement

All removable media and external storage devices are **NOT ALLOWED** for use with company data or on company systems unless explicitly approved by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

## What Is Covered

This policy applies to ALL removable media including but not limited to:
- SD cards and microSD cards
- Memory cards (CompactFlash, Memory Stick, etc.)
- External hard drives (USB, Thunderbolt, FireWire)
- External SSDs
- Optical media (CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray)
- Flash drives and USB sticks (see also: Flash Drive Policy)
- Floppy disks
- Tape storage

## Reasons

1. **Data leakage prevention**: Removable media bypasses network-level DLP controls
2. **Uncontrolled access**: Media can be shared, lost, or stolen without any tracking
3. **Malware risk**: External media is a known attack vector
4. **Compliance**: Regulatory frameworks require auditable, encrypted data handling

## Approved Alternatives

- Cloud storage (OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox Business)
- Secure file transfer portal (ShareFile)
- Encrypted email attachments
- VPN-connected network shares
- IT-managed file transfer service

## Exceptions

Only the CISO may approve exceptions. Approved exceptions require:
- Written justification
- Encryption of all data on the media
- Asset tracking tag on the device
- 30-day maximum approval window
- Automatic expiration
