# Flash Drive and USB Storage Policy

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Classification:** MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-15

## Policy Statement

Flash drives, USB storage devices, and all portable USB storage media are **FORBIDDEN** for use on company systems. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, temporary staff, and visitors regardless of role or seniority.

## What Is Prohibited

- USB flash drives (any brand, any capacity)
- USB thumb drives
- USB memory sticks
- Portable USB hard drives
- USB solid-state drives (SSD)
- Any device that presents as USB mass storage

## Reasons for This Policy

1. **No audit trail**: USB transfers cannot be logged or monitored, creating a blind spot in data loss prevention
2. **Data loss risk**: If a flash drive is lost or stolen, sensitive data is exposed with no recovery path
3. **Malware vector**: USB devices are a primary attack vector for malware introduction into corporate networks
4. **Compliance violations**: HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, and PCI-DSS all require auditable data transfer mechanisms — flash drives fail all of these
5. **No encryption guarantee**: Consumer flash drives lack enterprise-grade encryption, exposing data at rest

## Approved Alternatives

- **Cloud storage**: OneDrive, Google Drive, or Dropbox Business — encrypted, audited, access-controlled
- **Secure file transfer**: ShareFile or similar — encrypted in transit, logged, expiring links
- **Email with encryption**: Built-in Outlook/Gmail encryption for files under 25MB
- **Network file shares**: Department shared drives with access controls and audit logging
- **Managed file transfer (MFT)**: For large or sensitive transfers, use the IT-managed MFT portal

## Exceptions

There are **NO EXCEPTIONS** to this policy. This includes:
- Executive requests
- Temporary or one-time use
- Offline work scenarios
- Emergency situations
- Third-party vendor requests
- Personal devices used for work purposes

If you need to transfer data, use one of the approved alternatives listed above.

## Violations

Violations of this policy will result in:
1. Immediate confiscation of the USB device
2. Incident report filed with Information Security
3. Manager notification
4. Possible disciplinary action up to and including termination
