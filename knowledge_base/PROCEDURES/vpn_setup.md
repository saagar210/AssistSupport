# VPN Setup and Troubleshooting

## Initial Setup

1. **Download GlobalProtect** from the IT Self-Service Portal
2. **Install the client** — follow the on-screen prompts
3. **Enter the portal address**: vpn.company.com
4. **Authenticate** with your company credentials + MFA
5. **Enable auto-connect** in Settings > General > Connect on startup

## Common Issues and Fixes

### VPN Won't Connect
1. Verify internet connectivity (try browsing a public website)
2. Restart the GlobalProtect client
3. Check that no other VPN software is running (conflicts)
4. Verify your credentials haven't expired (try logging into SSO)
5. Restart your computer
6. If still failing, contact IT helpdesk with your error message

### Slow VPN Connection
1. Test your base internet speed without VPN
2. Try connecting to a different VPN gateway (Settings > Gateway)
3. Close bandwidth-heavy applications
4. If on Wi-Fi, try a wired connection

### MFA Not Working
1. Ensure your authenticator app is synced (check time settings)
2. Try an SMS code instead of push notification
3. Contact IT helpdesk if locked out
