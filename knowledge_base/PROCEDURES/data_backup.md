# Data Backup Procedures

## Automatic Backups

Your company laptop is configured for automatic backups:
- **OneDrive sync**: Desktop, Documents, and Downloads folders sync automatically
- **Frequency**: Continuous (real-time sync when connected to internet)
- **Retention**: 30 days of version history

## Manual Backup Options

If you need to back up additional files:
1. **Move files to OneDrive** — drag files into the OneDrive folder
2. **SharePoint upload** — for team/project files
3. **Network drive** — copy to your department's network share (N: drive)

## What NOT to Do

- Do NOT use USB flash drives for backup (see Flash Drive Policy)
- Do NOT use personal cloud storage for work data
- Do NOT rely solely on local storage — hardware can fail

## Restoring Files

1. **Recently deleted**: Check OneDrive recycle bin (retains 93 days)
2. **Previous version**: Right-click file in OneDrive > Version History
3. **Full restore**: Contact IT Helpdesk — they can restore from enterprise backup
