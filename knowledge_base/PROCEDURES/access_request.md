# Access Request Procedure

## How to Request Access to a System or Application

1. **Go to the IT Access Portal** at https://it.company.com/access
2. **Search for the application or system** you need access to
3. **Select the access level** (Read, Write, Admin)
4. **Provide business justification**
5. **Submit** — request routes to:
   - Your direct manager for approval
   - Application owner for approval (some apps)
   - IT Security review (admin-level access)
6. **Wait for approval** — typically 1-3 business days
7. **Access provisioned** — you'll receive an email confirmation

## Contractor Access

- Contractors must have a sponsor (full-time employee)
- Access limited to contract duration
- Auto-expires at contract end date
- No admin access for contractors unless CISO-approved

## Revoking Access

Access is automatically revoked when:
- Employee leaves the company
- Contract expires
- Manager requests revocation
- Annual access review identifies unnecessary access
