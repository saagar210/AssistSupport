# Software Request Procedure

## How to Request New Software

1. **Check the approved catalog** on the IT Self-Service Portal
2. **If software is in catalog**: Click "Install" — auto-deploys within 1 hour
3. **If software is NOT in catalog**:
   a. Submit a "New Software Request" form
   b. Include: software name, version, vendor, business justification
   c. Manager approval required
   d. IT reviews for security, licensing, and compatibility
   e. Typical approval: 3-5 business days
   f. If approved, IT deploys via SCCM/Intune

## What Can Delay Requests

- Missing business justification
- Software has known security vulnerabilities
- Licensing cost requires budget approval
- Software conflicts with existing tools
