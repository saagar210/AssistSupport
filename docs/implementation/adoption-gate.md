# Cross-Project Adoption Gate (Normative)

Cross-project rollout is gated by implementation exit criteria.

## Gate Rule

- Integration into other projects MUST NOT start until:
  - Phase 2 exit checklist is complete.
  - Phase 3 exit checklist is complete.

## Required Evidence

- Completed checklists:
  - `docs/implementation/phase-2-integration-surface.md`
  - `docs/implementation/phase-3-retrieval-expansion.md`
- Passing CI for contract and determinism tests.
- Consumer-facing migration notes for any contract changes.

## Current Status

- Gate satisfied for local rollout preparation as of 2026-02-07.
