## Delivery Scope
Close the multi-phase AssistSupport + MemoryKernel integration program through runtime cutover and stabilization completion.

## Final Baseline

- commit_sha: `7e4806a34b98e6c06ee33fa9f11499a975e7b922`
- service/api/integration: `service.v3` / `api.v1` / `integration/v1`

## Final Outcomes
1. Adapter-boundary architecture enforced.
2. Deterministic fallback preserved under failure modes.
3. Governance controls (pin/matrix/manifest/handoff) enforced in CI.
4. Runtime cutover executed and documented bilaterally.
